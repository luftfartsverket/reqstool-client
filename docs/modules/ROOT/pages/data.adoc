== Data

=== Data Source Types

Reqstool reads data from three (3) different sources:

* Local file system
* Maven Repository (zip file)
* Git Repository

@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Context>
!include <logos/git-icon>
!include <logos/maven>

=== Data Inputs

Reqstool reads both static (created by human) and dynamic data (generated by tool, e.g. Unit Test Reports):

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Container>
!include <office/Concepts/document>
!include <office/Concepts/book_journal>

title Data Input Overview

AddContainerTag("file", $sprite="document", $legendText="Input data file")
AddContainerTag("report", $sprite="book_journal", $legendText="Output file/stdout")

Container(reqstool, Reqstool, "reqstool client")
Container(reqs, Requirements, requirements.yml , $tags="file")
Container(svc, Software Verification Cases, software_verification_cases.yml, $tags="file")
Container(mvr, Manual Verification Results, manual_verification_results.yml, $tags="file")
Container(test_res, Test Report, Unit Test Reports,$tags="file")

Rel(reqs, reqstool, )
Rel(svc, reqstool, )
Rel(mvr, reqstool, )
Rel(test_res, reqstool, )

[[static-directory-structure]]
=== Static Data Inputs
`reqstool` will look for the following files in the location provided as an argument:

[listing]
----
📒 requirements <.>
  📄  manual_verification_results.yml <.>
  📄  requirements.yml <.>
  📄  reqstool_config.yml <.>
  📄  software_verification_cases.yml <.>
----
<.> Content source root
<.> See xref:yml/manual_verification_results.adoc[manual_verification_results.yml example]
<.> See xref:yml/requirements.adoc[requirements.yml example]
<.> See xref:yml/reqstool_config.adoc[reqstool_config.yml example]
<.> See xref:yml/software_verification_cases.adoc[software_verification_cases.yml example]

This means that if you run Reqstool like this:

```bash
reqstool report-asciidoc local -p /home/ms001/requirements
```

Reqstool will then look for the files specified above in the folder that's specified in the -p argument. 

[[dynamic-directory-structure]]
=== Dynamic Data Inputs

The structure of the files that are generated will differ from language to language (Java vs Python) and from build tool to build tool (Maven vs Gradle).

Currently, only Java using Maven is supported. A custom layout can be specified in xref:file_and_directory_set.adoc#reqstool_config[reqstool_config.yml].

The tree below shows where the dynamic files will reside after the project has been built. If you have a configuration where the requirements_annotations.yml and/or svcs_annotations.yml will be placed elsewhere after a successful build, Reqstool will need the path to those files specified in a reqstool_config.yml file. See link above for examples and further information.

[[maven-artifact-zip-directory-structure]]
=== Maven Artifact Zip Directory Structure

In order to produce a Maven Artifact Zip, you will need to incorporate the https://github.com/Luftfartsverket/reqstool-java-maven-plugin[Reqstool Java Maven Plugin] into your build process. 

During the build process, the plugin creates a zipfile with the static and dynamic files. The zipfile will be named like <<project-id>>-<<version>>-reqstool.zip and will be published under the target/reqstool folder.
The plugin will also combine the svcs_annotations.yml and the equirements_annotations.yml into one yml file called annotations.yml.

The Reqstool artifact uploaded as a zip to a Maven repository needs to have the following structure:

[listing]
----
📒 requirements  <.>
  📄 manual_verification_results.yml <.>
  📄 requirements.yml <.>
  📄 annotations.yml <.>
  📄 reqstool_config.yml <.>
  📄 software_verification_cases.yml <.>

== Handle imports

In order to import requirements or software verification cases from other sources, requirements.yml supports an import attribute. There are several ways to import content from other sources. This functionality could also be combined with <<filters>>

In order to import content from other sources, add something like the following to the requirements.yml

=== Local import

To import content from other sources (systems) on the same file system as your current project. 

.requirements.yml
```yaml

imports:
  local:
    - path: ../sys-001

```

=== Git import

To import content from other sources (systems) using git. 

The git key supports a optional value of an env_token, where you could enter a token to authenticate yourself in order to access the repository. 

Normally, you should refrain from entering token information explicitly, but rather point towards a secret only accessible through your development/production pipeline or environment variables. 

If no authentication is required in order to access the repository, the field `env_token` can be omitted


.requirements.yml
```yaml
imports:
  git:
    - url: https://github.com/Luftfartsverket/reqstool-demo
      branch: main
      path: docs/reqstool
      env_token: SECRET_TOKEN
```



=== Maven import

To import content from other sources (systems) using Maven. 

.requirements.yml
```yaml
imports:
  maven:
    - url: https://maven.pkg.github.com/Luftfartsverket/reqstool-client
      group_id: se.lfv.reqstool.testdata
      artifact_id: reqstool-testdata-test-basic-ms101
      path: ""
      version: 0.0.2
```

=== Import from different sources

It is also possible to import files from different types of sources. 

.requirements.yml
```yaml
imports:
  local:
    - path: ../sys-001
  git:
    - url: https://github.com/Luftfartsverket/reqstool-demo
      branch: main
      path: docs/reqstool
```

[[filters]]
== Filters

Filters can be applied on both requirements.yml and software_verification_cases.yml in order to exclude or include certain requirements or software verification cases. 


.requiremens.yml
```yaml
filters:
  sys-001:
    requirement_ids:
      includes: 
        - REQ_sys001_103
        - ext-001:REQ_ext001_101
```


.software_verification_cases.yml
```yaml
filters:
  sys-001:
    svc_ids:
      includes: 
        - SVC_sys001_101
        - SVC_sys001_109
```

== Categories

A requirement is assigned to one, or multiple categories.

.requirements.yml
```yaml
requirements:
  - id: REQ_ms001_101
    title: Title REQ_ms001_101
    significance: may
    description: Description REQ_ms001_101
    rationale: Rationale REQ_ms001_101
    categories: ["maintainability", "functional-suitability"]
    revision: 0.0.1
```

Categories follow the https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010[ISO 25010 0 Product Quality Characteristics].
