== Standard File and Directory Set

All files have a JSON Schema: https://github.com/Luftfartsverket/reqstool-client/tree/main/src/reqstool/resources/schemas/v1

For examples see:

* docs/examples https://github.com/luftfartsverket/reqstool-client/tree/main/docs/examples/requirements[examples]
* unit tests: https://github.com/luftfartsverket/reqstool-client/tree/main/tests/resources/test_data/data/local[test data]

[[reqstool_config]]
=== reqstool_config.yml
Contains file and directory configuration used by `Reqstool`.

The layout of files and directories for a project are depending on any of the following languages:

* java (build: maven): xref:data.adoc#dynamic-directory-structure[dynamic files] are relative "../../target" to the xref:data.adoc#static-directory-structure[static files]
* python (build: hatch/poetry): xref:data.adoc#dynamic-directory-structure[dynamic files] are relative "../../build" to the xref:data.adoc#static-directory-structure[static files]

If no reqstool_config.yml file is present in the folder that contains the xref:data.adoc#static-directory-structure[static files], Reqstool will expect all files and folders, even the dynamic ones, to reside in the path provided to the -p argument when Reqstool is run. This works well with a xref:data.adoc#maven-artifact-zip-directory-structure[Maven zip file directory structure]. 


If you are using a regular xref:data.adoc#java-maven-directory-structure[Maven] project, It is recommended to let all the xref:data.adoc#static-directory-structure[static files] be placed in a folder in the root of the project called 'requirements'. Your reqstool_config.yml file should also be placed in this folder, and would then only need to include the following:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luftfartsverket/reqstool-client/main/src/reqstool/resources/schemas/v1/reqstool_config.schema.json

language: java
build: maven
```


Below is an example on how to change the default paths to the required *.yml files and folders that are generated when the artifact is produced by Maven. The path specified for should be relative to the -p argument that you provide when Reqstool is run. 

In this case the reqstool_config.yml file is two dirs deep from project root.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luftfartsverket/reqstool-client/main/src/reqstool/resources/schemas/v1/reqstool_config.schema.json

type: java 
build: maven
resources:
  requirements: ../../target/some_folder/requirements.yml
  software_verification_cases: ../../target/some_folder/software_verification_cases.yml
  manual_verification_results: ../../target/some_folder/manual_verification_results.yml
  annotations: ../../target/reqstool/annotations.yml
  test_results:
    - ../../target/**/*.xml
```

=== requirements.yml

Contains all the requirements.

Below is an example of a requirement.yml file:

```yaml
metadata:
  urn: ms-101
  variant: microservice
  title: Some Microservice Requirement Title
  url: https://url.example.com

requirements:
  - id: REQ_101
    title: Title REQ_101
    significance: may
    description: Requirement with automated test and should have no implementation
    rationale: Rationale REQ_001
    categories: ["maintainability", "functional-suitability"]
    implementation: N/A
    lifecycle:
      state: obsolete
      reason: Superseded by REQ_102
    revision: 0.0.1
```

The `metadata` of the requirements.yml is required to describe the application.

in the `requirements` section, an array of requirements can be specified. Some of the fields are required

==== Required fields

* id: Must be unique within the project.
* title: A title of the requirement.
* significance: Could be `shall, should`` or `may`.
* description: Short text to describe the requirement.
* categories: Which categories the requirement relates to.
* revision: In which version of Reqstool client the requirement was introduced.

==== Optional fields

* rationale: Why this requirement is important.
* implementation: If this requirement requires a source code implementation or not. Currently, there are two acceptable values: in-code or N/A. This defaults to `in-code` if omitted. 
* lifecycle: Provides four options: "draft", "effective", "obsolete", "deprecated". Effective is the default if lifecycle is omitted. If set to obsolete or deprecated, reqstool will throw a waring during parsing when a requirement or svc is referenced in code or by other requirements, SVCs, or MVRs.


=== software_verification_cases.yml

Contains information about how specific requirements should be verified.

One of the fields to be set on a software verification case is the verification type which can be selected from five different pre-defined values (automated-test, manual-test, review, platform, other).

All but the automated-test value expects at least one manual verification entry of that particular software verification case. The automated test value expects at least one automated test should exist and preferably pass. 

=== manual_verification_results.yml
Contains information and the result of a manual verification case

=== requirement_annotations.yml

Typically generated by an annotations parser and lists all requirement annotations 

NOTE: JSON Schema

=== svcs_annotations.yml

Typically generated by an annotations parser and lists all software verification cases annotations.

=== annotations.yml

Lists all annotations, containing both requirements and software verification cases annotations.

Generated by default by python annotations parser.

Generated by Maven plugin for Java projects that combines requirements_annotations.yml and svcs_annotations.yml
